# Implementation Track

This file is the canonical workflow home for the implementation track: the runtime, the checker boundary, and the Agda-facing protocol contract.

The current method is **rising sea**: raise the waterline around the future contract before writing contract modules. The immediate work is to map prospective nouns and invariants to existing Agda substrate, not to start the app or open a protocol schema in code.

## Current Rule

Do not open `Concurrency/Protocol/` until the contract nouns and invariants are stable enough that the first module is forced by existing structure.

Do not use `Snapshot.agda` as a code name. "Snapshot" was a temporary prose word for an infancy-stage protocol state, not a project term. Later file names should be chosen from the contract shape itself; candidates include `Trace.agda`, `Run.agda`, `Record.agda`, `Boundary.agda`, and `Certificate.agda`, but none is reserved yet.

The first trusted checker should validate full finite traces before compact certificates. Certificates come later, after the trace predicate is explicit.

The implementation may know operational identities, network addresses, runtime keys, and other messy facts. The trusted kernel should not. Trusted records should use erased or opaque tokens and should not refine actor identity.

## Runtime Split

- **Elixir runtime:** actors, supervision, message routing, durable event log, synthetic large-scale stubs, operator-facing behavior.
- **Agda specification:** finite trace well-formedness, local-view restriction, session compatibility, no-leak/audit predicates, and boundary discipline.
- **Checker:** validates traces, and later certificates, emitted by the runtime against Agda-pinned predicates.
- **Pijul-shaped persistence:** stores document/protocol changes, dependencies, conflicts, resolutions, and partial views where that representation fits. Do not hard-couple the first runtime to Pijul internals.

The at-scale stub belongs in the runtime: thousands of participants, many content tags, and sibling protocols can be generated in Elixir. Agda examples should stay tiny and proof-facing.

## Durable Decisions From The Implementation Discussion

- Reuse existing vocabulary. Do not invent a parallel data model when the actor-causal site, finite-frame layer, session syntax, or presheaf machinery already supplies the noun.
- Anchor the first contract on the stable substrate: opaque actors, Lamport causal events, local frames and finite frames/covers, strict `FrameHom`s, and postulate-free `SessionType` / `SessionHom` syntax.
- Parameterize over moving parts instead of baking them into the contract: `session-O1-action`, Chu closed/evaluation structure, the cross-site `Allow ⊣ Require` adjunction, `MO_1`, the full Reality boundary, and the eventual content category Λ.
- Keep scale outside Agda. Large synthetic runs belong to the Elixir generator; Agda should receive tiny finite examples that exercise the same contract shape.
- Start with full trace/run validation. Compact certificates are a later optimization once the accepted trace predicate is explicit.
- Keep content opaque in v0. The current lean is an opaque content tag plus provenance fields from day one, with Chu-valued or Λ-valued content deferred.
- Do not extract the app from Agda. The runtime emits structured records; the checker validates them against Agda-pinned predicates.

## Substrate-Readiness Audit

Status legend:

- `G` grounded: existing Agda substrate already supplies the noun or invariant.
- `R` reuse with new relation: existing substrate supplies the carrier or law, but the protocol contract must add a relation/predicate.
- `O` opaque-stub-shaped gap: expected gap; future contract should add an opaque token or interface, not a rich theory.
- `B` boundary-facing/candidate: relevant to no-leak, Reality, audit, or implementation boundary; do not force a module yet.

### Contract Nouns

| Noun | Agda home | Exact type / field | Status | Caveat / future relation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Actor token | `Sites/ActorBase.agda` | `Actor : Type ℓ`; `Actor-set : isSet Actor` | G | Opaque and unityped by design. No decidable equality or fresh-name allocation in the kernel. |
| Event | `Sites/ActorBase.agda` | `Event : Type ℓE`; `Event-set : isSet Event` | G | Untyped occurrence. Unique event ids are a trace-level relation, not substrate. |
| Causal order | `Sites/ActorBase.agda` | `_≤_`, `≤-refl`, `≤-trans`, `≤-antisym`, `≤-isProp`; derived `Concurrent`, `≤-bidir-equal` | G | Lamport-style non-strict partial order. Conflict, choice, and event-structure refinements are deferred. |
| Conversation / local view | `Sites/ActorCausal.agda` | `LocalFrame` with `causal`, `ActorIn`, `touches`, `touches-in-frame` | R | A local frame is the current stand-in. A promotable first-class conversation object is still a gap; promotion is deliberately not a `FrameHom`. |
| Event incidence | `Sites/ActorCausal.agda` | `touches`, `touches-isProp`, `touches-in-frame` | G | `touches-in-frame` only says touched actors are in the frame. It does not say every actor is touched. |
| Event support | `Sites/EventSupported.agda` | `EventSupport`, `IsEventSupported`, `ChosenEventSupport` | G | This is the point-generated route's support condition: actor membership is generated by event incidence. |
| Local-view embedding | `Sites/ActorCausal.agda` | `FrameHom`: `actor-pres`, `event-map`, `touches-pres`, `causal-pres`, `causal-refl`; derived `event-map-injective`; alias `_↪_` | G | Strict causality reflection gives sub-view discipline. |
| Session tag ("how") | `Algebras/SessionSyntax.agda`; `Algebras/SessionMorphismSyntax.agda` | `SessionType`, `_^⊥ₛ`, `dual-involutive`, `SessionHom` HIT | G | Postulate-free. Assigning a session tag to a conversation is a new relation. Do not rely on `Sessions.agda` for this boundary; `session-O1-action` remains postulated there. |
| Content tag / payload ("what") | `Algebras/Sessions.agda`; `Hybrid/SessionPresheaf.agda` | `Payload : Type ℓv` parameter | O | Opaque-parametric precedent exists, but a contract-level `ContentTag` or Λ stub is not identical to send/receive payload. The contract still needs its own content-tag relation. |
| Finite event handle | `Sites/FiniteFrame.agda` | `event-count : ℕ`; `enum : Event ≃ Fin event-count` | G | Chosen, untruncated finite event enumeration. |
| Provenance token | none | none | O | Expected opaque token/interface. Trusted provenance should mention artifacts, events, protocol versions, translations, and derivation steps, not persons. |
| Protocol version / sibling reference | `Hybrid/Presheaf.agda` header only | future Reflexive-Π / Adapter-5 slot | O | No `ProtocolId`, version object, sibling-reference type, or Π category in code yet. |

### Contract Invariants

| Invariant | Agda home | Exact lemma / field | Status | Caveat / future relation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Causal acyclicity substrate | `Sites/ActorBase.agda` | `≤-refl`, `≤-trans`, `≤-antisym`, `≤-isProp` | R | The partial order rules prevent order-theoretic two-cycles. "Parents point backward" for a concrete trace is a new trace-level predicate. |
| Unique event ids | `Sites/ActorBase.agda` | `Event-set : isSet Event` | R | Set-truncation is grounded. Uniqueness of events in a finite trace is a contract predicate. |
| Unityped actors | `Sites/ActorBase.agda` | opaque `Actor` carrier plus no constructors / no decidable equality in the kernel | G | Structural no-branching discipline: actor origin is outside the verified kernel. |
| Valid local views | `Sites/ActorCausal.agda` | `FrameHom` | G | The morphism itself is the local-view validity condition. |
| Non-retroactivity-shaped discipline | `Sites/ActorCausal.agda` | `causal-pres` and `causal-refl` | B | Blocks rewriting causal sub-views. Versioned protocol edits still need the future Π layer. |
| Auditability-shaped separatedness | `Hybrid/Presheaf.agda` | `cover-jointly-monic` in `IsSeparatedPresheaf` | B | Compatible local sections determine a global section. Runtime trace auditability still needs event, provenance, and no-leak structure. |
| Cover / gluing substrate | `Sites/ActorCausal.agda`; `Sites/FiniteCover.agda`; `Sites/ActorPullback.agda` | `Cover`, `FiniteCover`, overlap frames, pullback projections, `pb-square`, pullback stability | G | Finite overlaps are actual pullbacks with carried finite enumerations. |

### Boundary-Facing Vocabulary

| Item | Agda home | Status | Caveat |
|---|---|---|---|
| No-leak, structural half | `Hybrid/ChangeOfBase.agda`; `Hybrid/LinearNonlinear.agda` | B | `frame-noninterference` proves change-of-base leaves the frame index unchanged. The full theorem that session roles/payloads/content do not refine actor identity remains a gap. |
| Reality boundary | workflow plus `Algebras/Chu.agda` header-level orientation | B | Workflow-grounded, not Agda-grounded. No `Reality` sort or module should be introduced from this alone. |
| Erasure / lossy admission | `Hybrid/Presheaf.agda` header only | O | Named future slot. Lossiness is intentional; it should not become reconstruction of Reality. |

## Findings

The future implementation contract is less green-field than it first looked. Actor tokens, events, causal order, local frames, local-view embeddings, finite event handles, session syntax, and point-generated support all already have Agda homes.

The gaps are mostly the right kind of gaps: opaque content tags, provenance tokens, protocol versions, sibling references, Reality-boundary requests, and full no-leak theorems. These should enter as small interfaces or predicates only after the contract prose fixes their role.

The current `Payload : Type ℓv` parameter is evidence that the code already accepts opaque content-like parameters, but it is not yet the content layer Λ and should not be treated as the final "what" tag.

The structural no-leak half exists as frame-noninterference under change of base. The semantic no-leak theorem remains future work.

## Next Contract Work

Before any Agda protocol module:

1. Write the contract prose for trace/run records using the audit table.
2. Decide the first code names; avoid `Snapshot`.
3. Decide whether content tags are separate from send/receive payloads in v0. Current lean: yes, opaque content tags from day one, Chu-valued content later.
4. Decide whether provenance v0 is only opaque tokens or already positive provenance circuits. Current lean: opaque tokens first.
5. Decide the checker boundary. Current lean: full trace validation first; compact certificates later.

Only after those decisions should Claude open a small Agda protocol layer.
